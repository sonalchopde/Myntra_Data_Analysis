# 📊 Myntra Data Analysis using Python  

## 📝 Project Description  
This project is an in-depth **data analysis of Myntra's real dataset**, focusing on **month-wise sales price trends** and customer purchasing patterns. The analysis was performed in **Google Colab** using Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  

The insights from this project help understand:  
✅ **How sales prices fluctuate over months** 📈  
✅ **The impact of seasonality on sales** 🌍  
✅ **Trends in customer purchases** 🛍️  
✅ **Data-driven decision-making in e-commerce** 💡  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Google Colab** 💻  
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computations) 🔢  
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of **real Myntra sales data**, including attributes like:  
📌 **Product Name**  
📌 **Category**  
📌 **Price**  
📌 **Discounts**  
📌 **Sales Date**  

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Key steps in the project:  
1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (Handling missing values, duplicates)  
2️⃣ **Month-wise Sales Price Analysis**  
3️⃣ **Using NumPy for numerical computations**  
4️⃣ **Visualizing Trends with Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
5️⃣ **Seasonal Impact on Sales**
